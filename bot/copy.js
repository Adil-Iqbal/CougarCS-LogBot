**How To Log Your Hours**

Copy the template below and paste it into <#${channelId}>. 
*IMPORTANT: Remember to update the info for your situation!*

\`\`\`
${LR_TEMPLATE}
\`\`\`

**Best Practices**
- Keep the value of the \`Name\` field consistent across all your requests.
- Never submit a log request for someone other than yourself.
- If anyone helped you in your task, remind them that they should submit their own log request.
- Try to limit conversation in <#${channelId}>.

**Cliff Notes on Log Requests:**
- The \`Name\` field should not be omitted.
- The \`Name\` field should not exceed 100 characters.
- The \`Date\` field accepts the following formats: \`mm/dd/yyyy\`, \`mm/dd/yy\`, \`mm/dd\`
- The \`Date\` field assumes *current year* when the year is omitted.
- The \`Date\` field assumes *today* when its omitted entirely.
- The \`Date\` field requires that a forward slash (\`/\`) separate days, months, and years.
- The \`Volunteer Type\` field should not be omitted.
- The \`Volunteer Type\` field should contain one of the following key words: text, voice, group, outreach, other.
- The \`Duration\` field requires \`Xh Ym\` format. (X and Y are whole numbers representing hours and minutes respectively)
- The \`Duration\` field can be omitted if the \`Volunteer Type\` field evaluates to "outreach".
- The \`Duration\` field should *not* be omitted if the \`Volunteer Type\` field does not evaluate to "outreach".
- The \`Comment\` field is optional for most volunteer types.
- The \`Comment\` field is mandatory if the \`Volunteer Type\` field evaluates to "other".
- The \`Comment\` field is *always* truncated to 140 characters.
