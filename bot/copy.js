**How To Log Your Hours**

Copy the template below and paste it into <#${channelId}>. 
*IMPORTANT: Remember to update the info for your situation!*

\`\`\`
${LR_TEMPLATE}
\`\`\`

**Best Practices**
- Never submit a log request for someone other than yourself.
- If anyone helped you in your task, remind them that they should submit their own log request.
- Please keep conversation in the <#${channelId}> channel to a minimum.
- Keep the value of the \`Name\` field consistent across all your requests.

**Cliff Notes on Log Requests:**
- The \`Name\` field should not exceed 100 characters.
- The \`Date\` field accepts the following formats: \`mm/dd/yyyy\`, \`mm/dd/yy\`, \`mm/dd\`
- The \`Date\` field requires that a forward slash (\`/\`) separate days, months, and years.
- The \`Volunteer Type\` field should not be omitted.
- The \`Volunteer Type\` field should contain one of the following keywords: text, voice, group, outreach, other.
- The \`Duration\` field requires \`Xh Ym\` format. (X and Y are whole numbers representing hours and minutes respectively)
- The \`Comment\` field is mandatory if the \`Volunteer Type\` field evaluates to "other".

**Volunteer Type Keywords**
- Use the **text** keyword when assisting a user via written correspondence.
- Use the **voice** keyword when assisting a user via audio or video correspondence.
- Use the **group** keyword when assisting more than one user simultaneously.
- Use the **outreach** keyword when advertising CougarCS to other potential users.
- Use the **other** keyword if no other keyword fits your use case.
